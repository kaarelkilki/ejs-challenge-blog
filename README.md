# ejs-challenge-blog
EJS challenge from Udemy course "The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp" by dr Angela Yu.

Over the course of 21 mini challenges I managed to complete the blog. Took me approx. 10 hints from the instructor and all the other knowledge was contributed by the help of mighty Google.

# Blog website upgrade (MongoDB)
The next step is to add a database to the blog.
